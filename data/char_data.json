I'd love to see her gain the ability to manage her energy expenditure a little better, so she doesn't need to eat like a horse every single meal... I mean, it's nice to see her thoroughly enjoy her food, but at the same time, I want to urge her to be more mindful of what she's putting in her body. It's never a good idea to just gorge yourself — you have to pay attention to nutrition and quantity, and especially limit your fat and sugar intake. Much better to get her diet under control now than have to deal with the consequences when she develops health issues later in life."
